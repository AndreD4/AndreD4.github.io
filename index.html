    <h1>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h1>
    <body>

        <p>
                padding is the space between the content and the border, 
                whereas margin is the space outside the border. 
                Here's an image I found from a quick Google search, that illustrates this idea.

            <h2>Padding</h2>
            <p>Padding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border). 
                If an element has a border around it, padding will give space from that border to the element content which appears in that border.
                 If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, 
                 because there is no border to give space from.</p>
             <h2>Margin</h2>
             <P>Margin is a CSS property that defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.

                    Margin affects elements that both have or do not have borders. 
                    If an element has a border, margin defines the space from this border to the next outer element. 
                    If an element does not have a border, 
                    then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.</P>  
                    <h2>border</h2>  
                    <p>well its a border.</p>
