# My Reflections - Sprint Four 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- What code readability habit will you begin implementing today?

block level elements i will be 100% implementing. due to always untidy code and 10% reason my hair falls out when i cant find or get confused becuase i cant find my code children




- Does code readability seem important to you, or unnecessarily fussy? Justify your answer.

Yes and no...  so i need to give both reasons now hahaha.
yes. why? becuase it makes life easier for you and who ever wants to read or go of base on your code, it need to be user friendly it needs to be easy to move around. yes it might be tedoius but it works out better in the long run.



now.....

my NO anwser... well because i work quite backwards, the way i think seems messy and weird but thats how my brain works. but its a habit i dont want to brea but just be more flexible, wow i just answered the question ....... my answer is yes, i think its important NOW hahahahaha
