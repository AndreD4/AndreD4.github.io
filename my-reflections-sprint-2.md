# My Reflections - Sprint Two 

In addition to the challenge specific reflections, answer the following questions in your reflection:


- How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies?



- Which parts of this sprint made you feel capable?



- Which parts of this sprint made you anxious?



- How's your self critical voice going? What kinds of things did it say to you this time? How much did they affect you?



- If you were at a bar and somebody asked you, "How do you make a website?" what would you say?




- Describe what you did in this exercise. Did you understand the steps that you were making? Can you describe them in simple lay terms?

Today i went on journey into the world of blog,html and css, and understanding how html and css play a big part in web development and the blog i will be working on.

Did i understand the steps? somewhat yes and no i understood that for me to make changes to the blog i needed to create a link of the html in my folder and to make a main css as well to be able to make changes.

describe html and css! hmm html is the blank site that i can write thing on it notes,poem,personal things and more.
css is what makes it pretty with colours and stuff hahaahah.

- Did you achieve the learning competencies and keep within the timebox?

yes i think i did pretty well i was 10 minutes over but i felt like i did well time wise.


- Remember to Stage, Commit and Push your changes.

OF COURSE LOL.
