    <p>Two woodcutters—a father and son—were trapped in the forest when a sudden blizzard arose. 
      They took shelter in an abandoned cabin, huddling in their clothes to sleep next to a meager fire. 
      In the middle of the night, the son awoke when the door banged open and an ethereally beautiful woman came in from the blizzard. 
      The woman crept over the father and blew her breath on him, then sucked up his living essence. As she turned to do the same to the son, she paused. 
      Captivated by his youth and beauty, the Yuki Onna said she would let him live, but only on the condition that he never speak of this night.
      The following winter, the young man was standing in his doorway when a beautiful woman traveler came walking by. 
      The man offered her refuge from the elements, and the woman accepted. They quickly fell in love, and the woman never made it to her destination. 
      She stayed on, married the young man, and they lived happily for years. They even had several children.
      One night, when the kids where happily playing, the man looked up at his wife and a memory surfaced that he hadn’t thought about in years.
      When his wife asked him what was the matter, he told her of his encounter with the snow spirit years ago, wondering if it had all been a dream. 
      The smile fell from his wife’s face, as she revealed herself to be that very same Yuki Onna.
      She was livid that her husband had broken her promise, and would have killed him there were it not for the children. As it was she left instantly, 
      leaving the husband behind with regret and sorrow.</p>
