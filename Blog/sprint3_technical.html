    <h1>javaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS</h1>
    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) can be broken down into HyperText, which is what grants access to other texts
        through links, and Markup which outlines the basic structure and appearance of raw text. What this means is that
        HTML describes and defines the content and basic structure of the website. It does this through a means of
        special tags or codes which tell the browser what to do. HTML is the bare basics of a website.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS</h2>
    <p>
        A Cascading Style Sheet is the website’s accessories. It’s responsible for outlining the colours, font and
        positioning of the content on a website. It adds some style and structure to the content. In order to make use
        of the CSS capabilities it needs to be linked within the HTML content so that style can be added to the website.
        CSS will tell the browser how to display the existing HTML.


    </p>

    <h2>JavaScript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript controls the behaviour of the website. It’s important to note that JavaScript and Java are two
        different things. JavaScript was designed to manipulate web pages and it is used to create interactive
        functionality. Without JavaScript a website will still be functional, but in a limited way. JavaScript is what
        animates HTML and CSS, and it’s what brings your website to life.

    <h1>Control flow and loops, arrays and objects</h1>
    <h2>im going to be honest my understanding is still on the fence and i dont feel comfortable
        at all so i will throw what understand and let me bro Bro explai the rest.
    </h2>
    <h2>Control flow</h2>
    <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.

        Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the
        (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.

        For example, imagine a script used to validate user data from a webpage form. The script submits validated data,
        but if the user, say, leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. To do this, the
        script uses a conditional structure or if/else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form
        is complete or not.

    </p>
    <h2>arrays and objects</h2>
    <p>
        In Javascript, there are only 6 data types defined – the primitives (boolean, number, string, null, undefined)
        and object (the only reference type). Arrays do not belong to this list because they are objects as well.

    <h1>What is a Function?</h1>
    <h2> Function? well this is what i know.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>A function is a subprogram designed to perform a particular task.</li>
        <li>Functions are executed when they are called.
            This is known as invoking a function.</li>
        <li>Functions are one of the fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. A function is a JavaScript procedure a
            set of statements that performs a task or calculates a value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>The DOM and DevTools</h1>
    <h2>The DOM</h2>
    <p>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the page so
        that programs can change the document structure, style, and content. The DOM represents the document as nodes
        and objects. That way, programming languages can connect to the page.

        A Web page is a document. This document can be either displayed in the browser window or as the HTML source. But
        it is the same document in both cases. The Document Object Model (DOM) represents that same document so it can
        be manipulated. The DOM is an object-oriented representation of the web page, which can be modified with a
        scripting language such as JavaScript.
