    <h2>whats the difference between EQ and IQ</h2>


    <P>
        Definition of IQ
        Intelligence Quotient, shortly known as IQ is an intelligent test score, obtained by a standardised intelligence
        test in which an individual’s mental age is divided by his chronological age and then multiplied by 100. The
        test aims at assessing a person’s cognitive capacity of thinking and reasoning. The term was first introduced by
        William Stern.

        IQ is a measure of the intelligence level of an individual, that is reflected in the score obtained by the
        person in the intelligence test as compared to the scores received by other people of the same age in the same
        test.</P>

    <p>Definition of EQ,
        EQ is an abbreviation for the term Emotional Quotient, which is defined as a person’s capability of identifying
        his own and other’s person’s emotions. It is a measure of the emotional intelligence level of an individual,
        which demarcates between different feelings and use this intelligence to guide thinking and behaviour.

        The term was first evolved in 1995, by Daniel Goleman a psychologist in his book on Emotional Intelligence. It
        is the ability of a person to identify, express and control his/her thoughts and actions, understand other
        people and rightly interpret their situations, make right and quick decisions, cope with pressures and crisis
        and so on. It has been researched that people with high EQ have better mental health, job performance, the way
        of living life.
